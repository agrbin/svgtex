        <p>We studied 5-hydroxy tryptamine type 3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptors transfected in
          tsA-201 cell line to examine serotonin-induced whole cell currents. Using the
          site-directed mutagenesis technique, we individually mutated each residue in the
          membrane-spanning M2 segment to histidine. A high proportion of tsA-201 cells
          cotransfected with the cDNAs of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R and CD8 produced large amplitude
          responses (0.5&#x02212;7.0&#x02009;nA) to serotonin. The dose-response curve of wild-type
          (WT) receptor ranging from 0.5 to 500&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mole increases its
            K<sub>d</sub> values, and V<sub>max</sub> of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R falls at low external pH
          as if protonation of an acid group is enough to block the channel. Lysine at position 281,
          a basic residue, is more susceptible to acidification-induced blockade of the
            5-HT<sub>3</sub>R channel. Dose-response curves of K281S (replacing lysine at the 281
          position with serine) at different pH are not significantly modulated, and histidine
          substitutions at the three consecutive positions 293, 294, and 296 eliminate the pH block
          of the channel.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Serotonin (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates
        and invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In vertebrates, 5-HT
        participates in the regulation of various physiological functions, including pain
        perception, blood pressure, sleep, homeothermia, and sexual activity. It is also believed
        that 5-HT may participate in the expression of symptoms of certain psychiatric disorders
        such as depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In 1991, however,
        evidence was presented indicating that the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor is a ligand-gated ion
        channel which, when activated, causes fast depolarizing responses in neurons [<xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thus 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, like acetylcholine, GABA, and
        glutamate, activates both G protein-coupled receptors and ligand-gated ion channels. The
        four hydrophobic putative transmembrane segments, found in other ligand-gated channel
        sequences and traditionally denoted as M1 through M4, are also present in the deduced amino
        acid sequence of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].
        The M2 segment shows particularly strong homology with other ligand-gated channels (<xref
          ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>). Similar to other (ligand-gated ion channels)
        LGIC receptors, more than one subunit have been identified. Two splice variants of A subunit
          [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and B subunit have been cloned [<xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In this study we have endeavoured to identify the
        amino acids lining the A homomeric 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor channel. Using site-directed
        mutagenesis in combination with patch clamp technique, we have identified the amino acids
        that appear to line the channel and are critical for the interaction with the ions passing
        through the channel.</p>
      <p>Karlin's group has developed an approach termed the substituted cystine accessibility
        method (SCAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] which they have used to show that
        the M2 domain of the A subunit of the mouse AChR is in alpha-helical conformation
        interrupted by an extended structure in the centre. We propose to examine the structure of
        the M2 region of the A 1 subunit of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure
          1b</xref>) using a slightly different yet potentially more powerful approach. We
        introduced histidine substitutions in the M2 region of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R to create a
        proton binding site (as the imidazole side chain of histidine can reversibly coordinate with
        Zn, Ni, and proton) at predetermined positions within the M2 domain, an approach we just had
        to term the substituted histidine accessibility method (SHAM). Any proton blockade observed
        in the mutant channels will be due to binding at the introduced site. We created a series of
        single histidine substitutions along the M2 region of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R (residues
        258&#x02013;277 or positions 1&#x02013;20, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>)
        for examining the proton binding site, and this periodicity provides the information for the
        secondary structure of the protein in the M2 domain.</p>

            of all the four members, regarding the presence of charged amino acids at either end of
            the channel and at hydrophobic leucine ring in the centre of the channel. These charged
            rings are responsible for channel conductance and anion/cation selectivity. (b)

          <p>Using the site-directed mutagenesis techniques, we have individually mutated each amino
            acid residue in the membrane-spanning M2 segment to histidine and we call this method
            SHAM. Every single mutation is a double mutation of K281S. This cartoon (based on
            Karlins experiments on nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) exhibits hypothetical structure
            of the amino acid residues lining the A homomeric 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R channel. In this
            diagram, Ni<sup>2+</sup> (an ideal candidate) is shown to be entering into the channel
            to react with I293H. In our experiments, we were able to test the substituted histidine

        <p>We isolated a complementary DNA clone containing the coding sequence of one of these
          rapidly responding channels; a 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R subtype has already been isolated by
          screening a neuroblastoma expression library for expression of serotonin-gated currents in
          a tsA-201 cell line.</p>
        <p>Briefly, a pair of oligonucleotides derived from the published sequence of the original
            5-HT<sub>3</sub>R cDNA was used to amplify a 460-bp fragment from RNA isolated from the
          murine neuroblastoma line NIE-115 using a reverse transcription/PCR kit (RNA PCR kit, P/E
          Express). This fragment was used to screen a plasmid cDNA library made from NIE-115 mRNA.
          A full-length cDNA clone corresponding to the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>RAs [<xref ref-type="bibr"

        <title>K281S affects pH and channel conductance</title>
        <p>Before generating SHAM mutants, we tested wild-type (WT) 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R for any pH
          sensitivity, as we will be using protons for probing the introduced histidine sites in the
          M2 region. Wild-type 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R appeared to be pH sensitive (see results), which
          could complicate our interpretation. For that reason we scanned the channel for the
          potential candidate or candidates responsible for this pH sensitivity. When we replaced
          lysine with serine (K281S), this mutant abolished the pH sensitivity observed in WT and
          there was no significant increase in the single channel conductance as recently documented
            [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This mutant does not show any alteration in
          the channel native properties. We used this mutant (K281S) as our control
          &#x0201c;WT&#x0201d; for generating SHAM mutants. Each of the 22 amino acid mutants
          generated is in fact a double mutant (ie, K281S/293H or K281S/294H, etc).</p>

        <p>This process was performed by using the altered sites mutagenesis system from Promega.
          All mutants were sequenced to confirm the correct mutation have been inserted. The mutant
            5-HT<sub>3</sub>R cDNA was then subcloned into vector PCI (Promega) for transfection

          prior to transfection. Maximal transfection was observed 36 to 72 hours after
          transfection.</p>
        <p>Transfected tsA-201 cells were transferred to a recording chamber and submerged in
          symmetrical extracellular recording buffer containing 140&#x02009;mM NaCl, 2&#x02009;mM

          immersed in the bath solution for 10&#x02013;15 minutes to allow for cellular
          stabilization before electrophysiological experimentation was conducted. Cells were
          clamped in whole cell configuration at a holding potential of &#x02212;70&#x02009;mV. An
            <italic>EPC 9 amplifier</italic> (HEKA) was used for measuring the current elicited in
          response to the application of agonist (5-HT from RBI), and was best used in combination
          with the <italic>PULSE software</italic> (HEKA, Mass). Agonists and antagonists were
          dissolved in extracellular solution and delivered to cells using an in-house rapid
          perfusion system. For K<sub>d</sub> values, current responses for each concentrations were
          normalized to the maximum response obtained from serotonin and fitted to the equation

      <p>Binding studies experiments were performed to test the receptor expression of
          5-HT<sub>3</sub> in tsA-201 cell line, whereas patch clamp experiments mostly in whole
        cell configuration were done to establish the functional properties of WT K281S and double
        mutants and to identify which amino acids are essential for ion interactions.</p>
      <p>A high proportion of tsA-201 cells cotransfected with the cDNAs of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R and
        CD8 produced large amplitude of current (0.5&#x02013;7.0&#x02009;nA) in response to
        serotonin in symmetrical solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4a</xref>) with an
          E<sub>rev</sub> close to zero (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).
        Nontransfected cells never showed a response to 5-HT (<italic>n</italic> = 20). The
        dose-response curve of WT receptor ranges from 0.5 to
        500&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mole. K<sub>d</sub> values and I<sub>max</sub> of A
        homomeric WT 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R fall at low external pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure
          4b</xref>), as if <italic>protonation of an acid group</italic> is enough to block the
        channel. Lysine at position 281, a basic residue, is more susceptible to
        acidification-induced blockade of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R channel. Dose-response curves of
        K281S (replacing lysine at the 281 position with serine) at different pH are not
        significantly modulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5b</xref>). Decay time
        constant is increased in mutant receptors as compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"
          >Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p>
      <p>Our preliminary studies show that receptors with histidine substitutions at one of three
        consecutive positions near the extracellular end of the M2 domain (positions 16, 17, and 19)
        are functional and eliminate the pH block (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>
        and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>) of the channel. I<sub>max</sub> and
          K<sub>d</sub> values of serotonin currents for K281S at &#x02212;70&#x02009;mV at pH 5.4,
        7.4, and 9.4 were very similar, and replacing histidine at positions I293H, I294H, and S296H
        (along with serine in place of lysine 281) in the channel lumen partially removes the pH
        block especially in case of S296H. Our data indicated that a properly placed histidine
        residue is an important structural element for functional expression as well as for pH
        regulation of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R. A brief electrophysiological and binding assay profile of A
        homomeric 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R (both WT and SHAM mutants) is present in <xref ref-type="table"
          rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p>
      <p>The present study investigated the amino acid critical for ion channel interaction of
          5-HT<sub>3</sub>R A subunit. 5-HT (type 3) is the only member of serotonin family which
        when activated opens the channel and responses within milliseconds. Recent studies indicated
        serotonin receptor type 3 involvements in both peripheral and central activities such as
        emesis, antiarrhythmic activity, pain, age-associated memory impairment, drug and alcohol
        abuse, migraine, psychosis, and fibromyalgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref
          ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We are
        trying to identify the amino acid lining the channel and exploring the potential of one or
        more than one amino acid critical for the blockage of channel and hence the resultant
        pathology such as in the case of Startle disease which results due to a single amino acid
        mutation in the Glycine receptor channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].
        Furthermore a complete scanning of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor channel will also provide us
        with a stronger tool for the specific antagonism of this receptor activity.</p>
