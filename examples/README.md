Most of the examples here are from the MathJax example pages:

* TeX:  http://www.mathjax.org/demos/tex-samples/
* MathML: http://www.mathjax.org/demos/mathml-samples/

To run the examples through svgtex, use the [test.pl](test.pl)
script, while the server is running in another shell.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/agrbin/svgtex/wiki#examples-and-benchmark) for
more information.

To see the results, open up [index.html](index.html) from a browser and follow the
